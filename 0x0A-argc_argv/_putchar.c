This is a C function definition for the _putchar function. Let's go through the code step by step:
#include < stdio.h > 
#include "main.h"
These lines of code include the standard input/output library stdio.h and the custom header file main.h. The custom header file may contain function declarations or other preprocessor directives.
/** * _putchar - writes the character c to stdout 
* @c: The character to print 
* 
* Return: On success 1. 
* On error, -1 is returned and errno is set appropriately. 
*/
This block of comments is called a function documentation or function header. It provides information about the _putchar function. It includes the function name, its purpose, and its parameter description. In this case, _putchar writes the character c to the standard output and returns 1 on success. If an error occurs, it returns -1 and sets the errno variable.
int _putchar(char c) 
{ 
return (write(1, &c, 1)); 
}
This code defines the _putchar function, which takes a single character c as an argument and returns an integer. Inside the function, the write function is called to write the character c to the standard output. The write function takes three arguments: the file descriptor (in this case, 1 for standard output), a pointer to the character c, and the size of the buffer (in this case, 1 for a single character). The function returns the value returned by write, which is the number of bytes written on success or -1 on error.
In summary, this function definition for _putchar provides an implementation for writing a character to the standard output. This function can be used by other C programs by including the main.h header file that contains the function prototype.
