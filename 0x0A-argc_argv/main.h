This is a header file main.h that contains function declarations for the _putchar and _atoi functions. Let's go through the code step by step:
#ifndef MAIN_H 
#define MAIN_H
These two lines of code are called include guards. They prevent the file from being included more than once in the same compilation unit. The #ifndef directive checks whether the macro MAIN_H is not already defined. If it is not defined, the #define directive defines the macro MAIN_H. If it is defined, the preprocessor skips the entire file until the #endif directive.
int _putchar(char c);
This line declares the _putchar function, which takes a single char argument and returns an int. This function is often used to print individual characters to the standard output.
int _atoi(char *s);
This line declares the _atoi function, which takes a char pointer as an argument and returns an int. This function is used to convert a string of characters representing an integer into an actual integer value.
#endif
This line closes the #ifdef directive started earlier. It tells the preprocessor to stop processing the file when it encounters this directive. The #endif directive matches the #ifndef directive, and the include guards are closed.
In summary, this header file main.h is used to declare the function prototypes of _putchar and _atoi, so that other source files can use these functions by including this header file in their source code.
